Clusters-Optimization: Unsupervised Learning
############################################

In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset of samples of the red variety of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The data includes measurements or expert assessments for 11 variables, 10 of which are continuous and one categorical (ordinal). The goal is to use data mining techniques to determine the number of clusters in the dataset, and to identify and report on the characteristics of each cluster.

Data Description
################
The dataset includes the following variables:

Fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm3)
Volatile acidity (g(acetic acid)/dm3)
Citric acid (g/dm3)
Residual sugar (g/dm3)
Chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm3)
Free sulphur dioxide (mg/dm3)
Total sulphur dioxide (mg/dm3)
Density (Low/Medium/High)
pH
Sulphates (g(potassium sulphate)/dm3)
Alcohol (vol.%)

Learning Outcomes
#################

Design methods to collect/gather data in a way that is suitable for the associated business problems to be analyzed.
Create summaries of data appropriate to the business problem that exists.
Communicate the nuances and ambiguities of statistical analyses undertaken and conclusions drawn from these.
Evaluate output produced by software packages used to implement statistical techniques.

Results
##############

1)Number of clusters in the dataset.
2)Characteristics of each cluster.
3)Differences between the clusters.

##############
Conclusion
##############

This project will allow us to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of the different clusters in the wine dataset, and will help us to identify patterns and trends in the data. The results of this analysis can be used to improve the quality and selection of the wine.
